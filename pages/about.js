            <p>
                Nottingham is the perfect blend of the professional corporates and the innovative independents and this
                bleeds right through to the tech scene. This unique and perfect mix of the traditional and contemporary
                is reflected in DDD East Midlands. It is part of the multi-national DDD conference community, but with a
                focus on promoting the talent, companies and the amazing tech community the East Midlands has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>The event follows these DDD Principles:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>

                    <li>All talk submissions are anonymous.</li>

                        to
                        see.
                    </li>
                    <li>The event is arranged with the community in mind.

            <p>
                One of the options offered to our kind sponsors is to fund live captioning of all talks. This would

                accessbile and enjoyable to as many people as possible. Dietary requirements will be covered, there is a
                code of conduct public on this webiste and more.

            <h2>About DDD</h2>
            <p>
                DDD was first formed as a conference in 2005, the first event happening in Reading, UK. Since then it
                has generated many spin-off events across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aims of the original DDD was to provide free technical education. During itâ€™s more than 10-year
                history, it has nurtured talented speakers, who have gone on to become Microsoft Most Valuable
                Professionals, Microsoft FTEs and to
                present at National and International Conferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the original DDD conference is focused on .NET, DDD East Midlands is going to be open to a range
                of talks within the field of technology. It is language and technology agnostic.

                Give them a follow on Twitter, say hi at the local events, offer them a coffee or some chocolate if they
                look in need.
            </p>
            <p>
                They will both be running around on the day of the event making sure your experience of it is the best
                they can possibly make it.
